Venztecmaps is my very first project in angular, it's a personal challenge about making a many-purpose software using google maps APIs, during the journey i will adding more features, i just want to say that i'm not a profesional with angular but i do my best, the final objetives of this project are several, but i'm going to say the most significant (at least for me) it's to learn to code in typescript and get into the deep world of Angular, expect me.
